title: Let's get going.

Originally I wrote my websites in CSS/HTML with some PHP to run the show. Those days are over, I'm a college student and I move a lot and lugging a 4U server around isn't very practical since I don't really want to pay for hosting. Not to mention sleeping in the same room as a server sounds like sleeping next to a vacuum cleaner. I've decided to host my website on github with static pages using Ruby+Jekyll and so far it's working really well. I'm new to blogging without a CMS like wordpress and so far I'm <em>really</em> impressed with what Jekyll can do.
